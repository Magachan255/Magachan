		<h1>How She Died.</h1>
		<img src="ma_selena-quintanilla.jpg" alt="" />
		<p>Selena unfortunately died at the young age of 23, on March 31, 1995. She was shot and killed by 
		Yolanda Saldivar who was the president of her fan club. She was suspected of having to steal from the 
		fans of Selena several times and stole from her boutiques. She was forcibly removed from being the president and this caused her to 
		become vindictive. She bought a gun the next day, she attempted to kill her four different times. At one 
		point she returned the gun but went back for it. Her fans saved her once as there were too many people for her 
		to do anything. The day she died Saldivar shot her in her right shoulder hitting a vital organ and she bled out 
		to death within minutes of being shot. Over 60,000 people came to the funeral to pay their respects and millions
		mourned her death.</p>
		<p>She became more famous with her death and later they released Dreaming of You in 1996. It was her English 
		album containing five songs and many traditional Tejano songs. She sold millions of copies. They made a movie 
		about her life starring Jennifer Lopez about a year after. There was a memorial concert in her honor in Houston 
		Astrodome. George W. Bush declared her birthday as Selena day as he was the governor of Texas. 
		She was a really great role model for everyone.</p>
