			<h1>Who is Selena?</h1>
			<img src="ma_selenaindex.jpg" alt="" />
			<p>Selena Quintanilla is one of the most famous and revered Latin musicians. She became lover by all 
			especially in the Hispanic and Latin community; and eventually gaining fame in America making Tejano 
			music well known. She is known as the “Queen of Tejano Music” and was awarded in 1995 for her albums 
			like Amor Prohibido and Selena Live. She eventually perished at the young age of 23 when she was at the 
			pinacol of her fame. She unfortunately died at the hands of the President of her fan club. They released 
			one last album called Dreaming of You after her passing in 1995.</p>
			<p>Born in Lake Jackson, Texas, Selena was born there on April 16, 1971. Selena’s parents were Abraham and 
			Marcella Quintanilla. Her father used to lead a band in his youth playing Tejano music.
			Because he started a family he left his musical career and instead he used his experience 
			to help manage and produce music for his family band called “Selena Y Los Dinos”.</p>
			<p>Selena started learning to perform at the young age of six and she was the youngest of the three children in 
			the family. Her father was teaching her older brother Abraham III how to play the guitar when she began to sing.
			Not long after he opened a restaurant where they performed there on weekends. Unfortunately, the family restaurant
			did not survive for long but the band was a small success with local people rooting for them. During her time in 
			Lake Jackson she only knew how to speak English and at 10 years old she began to learn how to speak Spanish by 
			singing it. She learned phonetically at the beginning and eventually became fluent with more practice.</p>
			<p>Her whole family moved out and to Corpus Christi, Texas it was her father’s hometown. They became traveling 
			performers and it eventually paid off. At one point they opened for the Mazz which was very popular at the time, 
			she was only eleven at the time and won everyone over. Her schooling wasn’t a main focus and stopped taking classes 
			in eight grades. She later on got her GED in 1989.</p>
